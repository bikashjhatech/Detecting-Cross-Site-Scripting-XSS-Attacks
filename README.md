✅ How XSS works: Gained an understanding of how XSS vulnerabilities are exploited.

✅ What attackers can do with XSS: Such as stealing user session information and capturing credentials.

✅ Different ways to prevent XSS: Techniques such as sanitizing user data, using the framework correctly, and keeping the framework up-to-date.

✅ How to detect XSS attacks: Methods for identifying XSS, including looking for special keywords (e.g., script, alert), checking for commonly used payloads, and looking for special characters like < and > in user input.
